# really-simple-todo-app-vuejs

```
This is a really simple To Do App build in Vue.JS.

It is licenced GNU Public License (GPLv2 or higher) so you can use it for whatever purpose you want to.
If you want to add to the project, I am happy if you send a pull request.

Please note, this project is not using a data store yet (but local storage), so any time you refresh it will reset your data.
If you want to store, save and edit your data, you need to setup a database and add the logic for that.
